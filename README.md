Solar Water Heating Inverter

This inverter is specifically designed to optimize the use of photovoltaic (PV) panels for powering a standard electric heating element in a domestic hot water (DHW) storage tank (boiler). It converts direct current (DC) from PV panels into alternating current (AC) with a 50 Hz rectangular waveform and a variable duty cycle ranging from approximately 3% to 98%.

In automatic mode, the inverter continuously measures voltage and current to calculate the output power of the PV panels. It dynamically adjusts the duty cycle to maintain the maximum power point (MPPT), ensuring optimal energy extraction. Without this feature, a fixed full-duty load on the panels—especially in low-light conditions—would cause voltage to drop, resulting in minimal power output. Thanks to MPPT tracking, the inverter excels even in weak or fluctuating sunlight, such as during early mornings, evenings, cloudy skies, or partial shading.

Example: Setting the duty cycle manually to 100% under weak sunlight may result in as little as 300 W from a nominal 750 W PV system. With MPPT enabled, the inverter can extract significantly more energy by adjusting the load intelligently.

Installation and Usage Guidelines:

    The inverter should be placed as close as possible to the boiler.

    The output terminals must only be connected to purely resistive loads (e.g., heating element, immersion heater, standard boiler without electronics or contactors).

    The output must not be connected to ground, other inverters, or any external voltage sources.
